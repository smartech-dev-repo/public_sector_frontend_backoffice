# Admin Permissions Guide

Which permission key guards which admin endpoint, and how the guard mechanism actually resolves that per route.

## How it works

- **Guard**: `src/auth/permissions.guard.ts` — `PermissionsGuard.canActivate()`
  reads required permissions via
  `Reflector.getAllAndOverride<string[]>(PERMISSIONS_KEY, [handler, class])`.
  **A method-level decorator overrides the class-level one entirely** (not
  merged) — see the one place this actually happens, flagged below. If no
  decorator is present at either level, the guard passes everyone through
  with no permission check (the route still requires a valid admin JWT via
  `JwtAuthGuard`/`AdminOnlyGuard`, just no specific permission).
- **Decorator**: `src/auth/permissions.decorator.ts` —
  `@RequirePermissions('key:action', ...)`, backed by `SetMetadata` under
  `PERMISSIONS_KEY = 'requiredPermissions'`.
- Permission keys are seeded in `prisma/seed.ts`'s `BOOTSTRAP_PERMISSIONS`
  and granted per-role via `admin/roles`; the bootstrap `SUPER_ADMIN` role
  gets every key.
- Admin auth itself (`/auth/admin/*`) lives outside the `admin/*` path
  prefix — easy to miss if you're grepping by path convention alone.

**29 keys total.** The bootstrap `SUPER_ADMIN` role is granted every one of them.
Every key above is referenced by at least one route, and every route's
`@RequirePermissions(...)` string matches one of these keys exactly — no
unused permissions, no typos, as of this writing.

## Keeping this current

This is a snapshot, not generated at build time — if a new admin
controller/route is added, update the relevant table here (and
`postman/public-sector-backend.postman_collection.json`, per this
project's standing CLAUDE.md rule) in the same change.
